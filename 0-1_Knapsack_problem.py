"""
In the 0-1 Knapsack Problem, we have a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a weight capacity. The goal is to maximize the total value of items placed in the knapsack without exceeding the weight capacity. Unlike the fractional knapsack, here we can't take fractions of itemsâ€”each item can either be included entirely or excluded (0-1).


Dynamic Programming : Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing their solutions for future use.
